Description:
After downloading the data, I started exploring the data and faced with some missing, and invalid data. I did not drop any record from the dataset, but instead I tried to replace them with valid data. 
After cleaning the data, started plotting some exploratory graphs to get overall trend in the data. 
I narrowed down my scope from a perspective of competitor who wants to compete Airbnb in Sydney, Australia. I pinpointed the potential neighborhoods, property type. As well as tried to show the reasonable pricing and time of the year with good market. The last but not the least, analyzed the customer feedbacks.
